# Smart_window-door_and_roof-lift_control_using_MCU_for_Electric-vehicle
I'm using sensors like DHT and rain to sense temperature &amp; rain.Then using a threshold value to control the window door and roof lift of an electric car by actuating motors.And also  I'm controlling the ac mechanism for efficient optimisation of battery usage.
